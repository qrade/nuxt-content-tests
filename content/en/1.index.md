# english home page

Hello, I'm the english home page. You see me in both ContentDoc instances because the index.md file has a 1. prefix.

Look what happens in a subfolder where there is a index.md file without a prefix and another file with a name that comes before index.md in the alphabet: [messyfolder](messyfolder)

Try to navigate to [foo](foo) (file foo.md in the same directory)
